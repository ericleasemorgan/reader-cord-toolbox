This was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to be able to string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was to be the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses, whom he was dishonouring in his own house-egging the others on to do so also.	./cache/homer-odyssey-850_21.txt	./txt/homer-odyssey-850_21.txt
