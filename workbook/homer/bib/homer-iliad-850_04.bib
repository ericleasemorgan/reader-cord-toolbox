He gave his orders to the knights first, bidding them hold their horses well in hand, so as to avoid confusion." Let no man," he said," relying on his strength or horsemanship, get before the others and engage singly with the Trojans, nor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken your attack; but let each when he meets an enemy 's chariot throw his spear from his own; this be much the best; this is how the men of old took towns and strongholds; in this wise were they minded."	./cache/homer-iliad-850_04.txt	./txt/homer-iliad-850_04.txt
