homer-iliad-850_07	"What would you have,"said he,"daughter of great Jove, that your proud spirit has sent you hither from Olympus?
homer-iliad-850_07	Have you no pity upon the Trojans, and would you incline the scales of victory in favour of the Danaans?
homer-iliad-850_07	How would it not grieve him could he hear of them as now quailing before Hector?
homer-iliad-850_07	Jove was displeased and answered,"What, O shaker of the earth, are you talking about?
homer-iliad-850_07	See you not how the Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven a trench all round it, without offering hecatombs to the gods?
homer-iliad-850_07	Tell me, then, how do you propose to end this present fighting?"
homer-iliad-850_06	"Who, my good sir,"said he,"who are you among men?
homer-iliad-850_06	And the son of Hippolochus answered,"son of Tydeus, why ask me of my lineage?
homer-iliad-850_06	Are the Achaeans, woe betide them, pressing you hard about the city that you have thought fit to come and uplift your hands to Jove from the citadel?
homer-iliad-850_06	Has, then, your house fared so well at the hands of the Trojans?
homer-iliad-850_06	She took his hand within her own and said,"My son, why have you left the battle to come hither?
homer-iliad-850_06	Was it to my sisters, or to my brothers''wives?
homer-iliad-850_06	or is she at the temple of Minerva where the other women are propitiating the awful goddess?"
homer-iliad-850_09	Are the sons of Atreus the only men in the world who love their wives?
homer-iliad-850_09	Sir, think you that the sons of the Achaeans are indeed as unwarlike and cowardly as you say they are?
homer-iliad-850_09	Tell me, Ulysses,"said he,"will he save the ships from burning, or did he refuse, and is he still furious?"
homer-iliad-850_09	Was it not for the sake of Helen?
homer-iliad-850_09	What made the son of Atreus gather the host and bring them?
homer-iliad-850_09	Who can be other than dismayed?
homer-iliad-850_09	Why, pray, must the Argives needs fight the Trojans?
homer-iliad-850_01	"Dread son of Saturn,"answered Juno,"what are you talking about?
homer-iliad-850_01	Achilles drew a deep sigh and said,"You know it; why tell you what you know well already?
homer-iliad-850_01	And Achilles answered,"Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond all mankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize?
homer-iliad-850_01	And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel?
homer-iliad-850_01	Are you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss and give up the girl at your bidding?
homer-iliad-850_01	Granted that the gods have made him a great warrior, have they also given him the right to speak with railing?"
homer-iliad-850_01	I?
homer-iliad-850_01	Pry and ask questions?
homer-iliad-850_01	To see the pride of Agamemnon, son of Atreus?
homer-iliad-850_01	Trickster,"she cried,"which of the gods have you been taking into your counsels now?
homer-iliad-850_01	Was it not heaven that made you so?
homer-iliad-850_01	What is it that grieves you?
homer-iliad-850_01	What though you be brave?
homer-iliad-850_01	Why are you here,"said he,"daughter of aegis- bearing Jove?
homer-iliad-850_01	With what heart can any of the Achaeans do your bidding, either on foray or in open fighting?
homer-iliad-850_02	"Agamemnon,"he cried,"what ails you now, and what more do you want?
homer-iliad-850_02	How dare you gibe at Agamemnon because the Danaans have awarded him so many prizes?
homer-iliad-850_02	Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, with our drink- offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein we have put our trust?
homer-iliad-850_02	Where are our covenants now, and where the oaths that we have taken?
homer-iliad-850_02	Who, then, O Muse, was the foremost, whether man or horse, among those that followed after the sons of Atreus?
homer-iliad-850_02	Why, Achaeans,''said he,''are you thus speechless?
homer-iliad-850_02	Will you leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes?
homer-iliad-850_02	Would you have yet more gold, which some Trojan is to give you as a ransom for his son, when I or another Achaean has taken him prisoner?
homer-iliad-850_02	or is it some young girl to hide and lie with?
homer-iliad-850_03	And now can you not dare face Menelaus and learn what manner of man he is whose wife you have stolen?
homer-iliad-850_03	Are you going to send me afield still further to some man whom you have taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia?
homer-iliad-850_03	Did you not, such as you are, get your following together and sail beyond the seas?
homer-iliad-850_03	Priam then caught sight of Ajax and asked,"Who is that great and goodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the rest of the Argives?"
homer-iliad-850_03	Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great and goodly?
homer-iliad-850_03	Where indeed would be your lyre and your love- tricks, your comely locks and your fair favour, when you were lying in the dust before him?
homer-iliad-850_03	Will not the Achaeans mock at us and say that we have sent one to champion us who is fair to see but who has neither wit nor courage?
homer-iliad-850_04	Dread son of Saturn,"said she,"what, pray, is the meaning of all this?
homer-iliad-850_04	How can you say that we are slack?
homer-iliad-850_04	Jove was angry and answered,"My dear, what harm have Priam and his sons done you that you are so hotly bent on sacking the city of Ilius?
homer-iliad-850_04	Son of Tydeus,"he said,"why stand you cowering here upon the brink of battle?
homer-iliad-850_04	This shall surely be; but how, Menelaus, shall I mourn you, if it be your lot now to die?
homer-iliad-850_04	Ulysses glared at him and answered,"Son of Atreus, what are you talking about?
homer-iliad-850_04	We must consider what we shall do about all this; shall we set them fighting anew or make peace between them?
homer-iliad-850_04	Will nothing do for you but you must within their walls and eat Priam raw, with his sons and all the other Trojans to boot?
homer-iliad-850_05	Father Jove,"said she,"are you not angry with Mars for these high doings?
homer-iliad-850_05	He showed Jove the immortal blood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously, saying,"Father Jove, are you not angered by such doings?
homer-iliad-850_05	Hector,"said he,"where is your prowess now?
homer-iliad-850_05	Sarpedon,"said he,"councillor of the Lycians, why should you come skulking here you who are a man of peace?
homer-iliad-850_05	Sons of Priam,"said he,"how long will you let your people be thus slaughtered by the Achaeans?
homer-iliad-850_05	Then he said to his men,"My friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the spear so well?
homer-iliad-850_05	Who, then, was first and who last to be slain by Mars and Hector?
homer-iliad-850_05	Would you wait till they are at the walls of Troy?
homer-iliad-850_08	"Son of Tydeus,"replied Nestor,"what mean you?
homer-iliad-850_08	"Ulysses,"he cried,"noble son of Laertes where are you flying to, with your back turned like a coward?
homer-iliad-850_08	Are you fatigued with killing so many of your dear friends the Trojans?
homer-iliad-850_08	Are you mad?
homer-iliad-850_08	Can you find no compassion in your heart for the dying Danaans, who bring you many a welcome offering to Helice and to Aegae?
homer-iliad-850_08	Father Jove, did you ever so ruin a great king and rob him so utterly of his greatness?
homer-iliad-850_08	King Neptune was greatly troubled and answered,"Juno, rash of tongue, what are you talking about?
homer-iliad-850_08	Then he was afraid and said to Diomed,"Son of Tydeus, turn your horses in flight; see you not that the hand of Jove is against you?
homer-iliad-850_08	Then said she to the mighty god of Neptune,"What now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake?
homer-iliad-850_08	What,"said she,"are you about?
homer-iliad-850_08	Which of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill?
homer-iliad-850_12	Then he said to Glaucus son of Hippolochus,"Glaucus, why in Lycia do we receive especial honour as regards our place at table?
homer-iliad-850_12	Then he turned round and shouted to the brave Lycians saying,"Lycians, why do you thus fail me?
homer-iliad-850_12	What care I whether they fly towards dawn or dark, and whether they be on my right hand or on my left?
homer-iliad-850_12	Why are the choicest portions served us and our cups kept brimming, and why do men look up to us as though we were gods?
homer-iliad-850_12	Why are you so fearful?
homer-iliad-850_11	"Hero Eurypylus,"replied the brave son of Menoetius,"how may these things be?
homer-iliad-850_11	Alas,"said he to himself in his dismay,"what will become of me?
homer-iliad-850_11	And Nestor answered,"Why should Achilles care to know how many of the Achaeans may be wounded?
homer-iliad-850_11	But why talk to myself in this way?
homer-iliad-850_11	My good friend, did not Menoetius charge you thus, on the day when he sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon?
homer-iliad-850_11	Say, noble Eurypylus, will the Achaeans be able to hold great Hector in check, or will they fall now before his spear?"
homer-iliad-850_11	Tell me now ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who, whether of the Trojans or of their allies, was first to face Agamemnon?
homer-iliad-850_11	What can I do?
homer-iliad-850_11	What do you want with me?"
homer-iliad-850_11	What, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam killed in the hour of triumph which Jove then vouchsafed him?
homer-iliad-850_11	Why,"said he,"Achilles, do you call me?
homer-iliad-850_11	Will he wait till the ships, do what we may, are in a blaze, and we perish one upon the other?
homer-iliad-850_10	"Who is it,"said he,"that goes thus about the host and the ships alone and in the dead of night, when men are sleeping?
homer-iliad-850_10	"Why,"said he,"my dear brother, are you thus arming?
homer-iliad-850_10	Am I to stay with them and wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I have given your orders?"
homer-iliad-850_10	Are there no younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to rouse the princes?
homer-iliad-850_10	Are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit the Trojans?
homer-iliad-850_10	Are you looking for one of your mules or for some comrade?
homer-iliad-850_10	But tell me, and tell me true, where did you leave Hector when you started?
homer-iliad-850_10	Can you not see that the Trojans are encamped on the brow of the plain hard by our ships, with but a little space between us and them?"
homer-iliad-850_10	Did you steal in among the Trojan forces, or did some god meet you and give them to you?
homer-iliad-850_10	He came outside his tent and said,"Why do you go thus alone about the host, and along the line of the ships in the stillness of the night?
homer-iliad-850_10	How can you sleep on in this way?
homer-iliad-850_10	How, too, are the watches and sleeping- ground of the Trojans ordered?
homer-iliad-850_10	Is it to plunder the bodies of the slain, or did Hector send you to spy out what was going on at the ships?
homer-iliad-850_10	Is there one,"said he,"who for a great reward will do me the service of which I will tell you?
homer-iliad-850_10	Menelaus replied,"How do I take your meaning?
homer-iliad-850_10	Or did you come here of your own mere notion?"
homer-iliad-850_10	Tell me,"said he,"renowned Ulysses, how did you two come by these horses?
homer-iliad-850_10	The Lysians and proud Mysians, with the Phrygians and Meonians, have their place on the side towards Thymbra; but why ask about all this?
homer-iliad-850_10	Ulysses then said,"Now tell me; are they sleeping among the Trojan troops, or do they lie apart?
homer-iliad-850_10	What are their plans?
homer-iliad-850_10	What is it that you find so urgent?"
homer-iliad-850_10	What is your business?"
homer-iliad-850_10	Where lies his armour and his horses?
homer-iliad-850_10	Will they stay here by the ships and away from the city, or now that they have worsted the Achaeans, will they retire within their walls?"
homer-iliad-850_17	As for the others that came into the fight after these, who of his own self could name them?
homer-iliad-850_17	In his likeness, then, Apollo said,"Aeneas, can you not manage, even though heaven be against us, to save high Ilius?
homer-iliad-850_17	Was it that you might share the sorrows that befall mankind?
homer-iliad-850_17	What then will be our best plan both as regards rescuing the dead, and our own escape from death amid the battle- cries of the Trojans?"
homer-iliad-850_17	Why, however, should I thus hesitate?
homer-iliad-850_17	what shall I do?
homer-iliad-850_19	What could I do?
homer-iliad-850_19	Who can either hear or speak in an uproar?
homer-iliad-850_19	Would you have men eat while the bodies of those whom Hector son of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon the plain?
homer-iliad-850_16	"Shame on you, where are you flying to?
homer-iliad-850_16	Achilles was deeply moved and answered,"What, noble Patroclus, are you saying?
homer-iliad-850_16	And Juno answered,"Most dread son of Saturn, what is this that you are saying?
homer-iliad-850_16	Dead though he was, Hector still spoke to him saying,"Patroclus, why should you thus foretell my doom?
homer-iliad-850_16	Have you anything to say to the Myrmidons or to myself?
homer-iliad-850_16	Who in future story will speak well of you unless you now save the Argives from ruin?
homer-iliad-850_16	Who knows but Achilles, son of lovely Thetis, may be smitten by my spear and die before me?"
homer-iliad-850_16	Who then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroclus, when the gods had now called you to meet your doom?
homer-iliad-850_16	Would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has long been fated, out of the jaws of death?
homer-iliad-850_16	or have you had news from Phthia which you alone know?
homer-iliad-850_14	And Juno said,"Sleep, why do you take such notions as those into your head?
homer-iliad-850_14	Do you think Jove will be as anxious to help the Trojans, as he was about his own son?
homer-iliad-850_14	He went up to her and said,"What do you want that you have come hither from Olympus-- and that too with neither chariot nor horses to convey you?"
homer-iliad-850_14	Is it thus that you would quit the city of Troy, to win which we have suffered so much hardship?
homer-iliad-850_14	Most dread son of Saturn,"she exclaimed,"what are you talking about?
homer-iliad-850_14	Then King Agamemnon said to him,"Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither?
homer-iliad-850_14	Ulysses looked fiercely at him and said,"Son of Atreus, what are you talking about?
homer-iliad-850_14	What if one of the ever- living gods should see us sleeping together, and tell the others?
homer-iliad-850_14	Would you have us enjoy one another here on the top of Mount Ida, where everything can be seen?
homer-iliad-850_18	Alas,"said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart,"why are the Achaeans again scouring the plain and flocking towards the ships?
homer-iliad-850_18	And Achilles said,"Iris, which of the gods was it that sent you to me?"
homer-iliad-850_18	And Juno answered,"Dread son of Saturn, why should you say this thing?
homer-iliad-850_18	Have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls?
homer-iliad-850_18	His mother went up to him as he lay groaning; she laid her hand upon his head and spoke piteously, saying,"My son, why are you thus weeping?
homer-iliad-850_18	May not a man though he be only mortal and knows less than we do, do what he can for another person?
homer-iliad-850_18	Then fleet Achilles answered her saying,"How can I go up into the battle?
homer-iliad-850_18	What is there for me?
homer-iliad-850_18	What sorrow has now befallen you?
homer-iliad-850_13	Alexandrus answered,"Hector, why find fault when there is no one to find fault with?
homer-iliad-850_13	Are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon hurting you?
homer-iliad-850_13	Idomeneus,"said he,"lawgiver to the Cretans, what has now become of the threats with which the sons of the Achaeans used to threaten the Trojans?"
homer-iliad-850_13	On the right wing of the host, in the centre, or on the left wing, where I take it the Achaeans will be weakest?"
homer-iliad-850_13	Paris,"said he,"evil- hearted Paris, fair to see but woman- mad and false of tongue, where are Deiphobus and King Helenus?
homer-iliad-850_13	Sir,"he cried,"draw near; why do you think thus vainly to dismay the Argives?
homer-iliad-850_13	Son of Deucalion,"said he,"where would you have us begin fighting?
homer-iliad-850_13	Where are Adamas son of Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus?
homer-iliad-850_13	Where too is Othryoneus?
homer-iliad-850_13	or have you been sent to fetch me?
homer-iliad-850_15	And you seem troubled-- has your husband the son of Saturn been frightening you?"
homer-iliad-850_15	Apollo stood beside him and said,"Hector son of Priam, why are you so faint, and why are you here away from the others?
homer-iliad-850_15	Can we hope to find helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield us more surely than the one we have?
homer-iliad-850_15	Can you not hear him cheering on his whole host to fire our fleet, and bidding them remember that they are not at a dance but in battle?
homer-iliad-850_15	Do you not remember how once upon a time I had you hanged?
homer-iliad-850_15	Do you think, if Hector takes them, that you will be able to get home by land?
homer-iliad-850_15	Has any mishap befallen you?"
homer-iliad-850_15	He then with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:"What, in heaven''s name, do I now see?
homer-iliad-850_15	Hector in a weak voice answered,"And which, kind sir, of the gods are you, who now ask me thus?
homer-iliad-850_15	Hector now rebuked him and said,"Why, Melanippus, are we thus remiss?
homer-iliad-850_15	Iris fleet as the wind then answered,"Am I really, Neptune, to take this daring and unyielding message to Jove, or will you reconsider your answer?
homer-iliad-850_15	Is it not Hector come to life again?
homer-iliad-850_15	Juno,"said she,"why are you here?
homer-iliad-850_15	do you take no note of the death of your kinsman, and do you not see how they are trying to take Dolops''s armour?
homer-iliad-850_23	And Achilles answered,"Why, true heart, are you come hither to lay these charges upon me?
homer-iliad-850_23	Antilochus,"said he,"what is this from you who have been so far blameless?
homer-iliad-850_23	He stood up and said among the Argives,"My friends, princes and counsellors of the Argives, can you see the running as well as I can?
homer-iliad-850_23	Is it not enough that I should fall short of you in actual fighting?
homer-iliad-850_23	Why, my good fellows, are you lagging?
homer-iliad-850_22	Alas, my son,"she cried,"what have I left to live for now that you are no more?
homer-iliad-850_22	Have you not yet found out that it is a god whom you pursue so furiously?
homer-iliad-850_22	Then Minerva said,"Father, wielder of the lightning, lord of cloud and storm, what mean you?
homer-iliad-850_22	Then Phoebus Apollo spoke to the son of Peleus saying,"Why, son of Peleus, do you, who are but man, give chase to me who am immortal?
homer-iliad-850_22	What say you?
homer-iliad-850_22	What, again, if I were to lay down my shield and helmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight up to noble Achilles?
homer-iliad-850_22	Would you pluck this mortal whose doom has long been decreed out of the jaws of death?
homer-odyssey-850_02	Has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish to warn us, or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment?
homer-odyssey-850_02	Leiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying,"Mentor, what folly is all this, that you should set the people to stay us?
homer-odyssey-850_02	Or will he go to Ephyra as well, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?"
homer-odyssey-850_02	Telemachus answered,"Antinous, how can I drive the mother who bore me from my father''s house?
homer-odyssey-850_02	Was it not enough that you should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet a boy?
homer-odyssey-850_02	When Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly to him, saying,"My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that into your head?
homer-odyssey-850_02	Where in the world do you want to go to-- you, who are the one hope of the house?
homer-iliad-850_20	Aeneas,"said he,"why do you stand thus out before the host to fight me?
homer-iliad-850_20	And Aeneas answered,"Why do you thus bid me fight the proud son of Peleus, when I am in no mind to do so?
homer-iliad-850_20	Are you considering some matter that concerns the Trojans and Achaeans-- for the blaze of battle is on the point of being kindled between them?"
homer-iliad-850_20	Has he not at all times offered acceptable sacrifice to the gods that dwell in heaven?
homer-iliad-850_20	Have you forgotten how when you were alone I chased you from your herds helter- skelter down the slopes of Ida?
homer-iliad-850_20	Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans in the seat of Priam?
homer-iliad-850_20	Or have the Trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness, fair with orchard lawns and corn lands, if you should slay me?
homer-iliad-850_20	Why should this man suffer when he is guiltless, to no purpose, and in another''s quarrel?
homer-iliad-850_20	Why,"said he,"wielder of the lightning, have you called the gods in council?
homer-iliad-850_20	what marvel am I now beholding?
homer-odyssey-850_03	"But how, Mentor,"replied Telemachus,"dare I go up to Nestor, and how am I to address him?
homer-odyssey-850_03	And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far better a man than himself?
homer-odyssey-850_03	Are you traders?
homer-odyssey-850_03	But we suffered much more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story?
homer-odyssey-850_03	Do you submit to this tamely, or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you?
homer-odyssey-850_03	On this Minerva said,"Telemachus, what are you talking about?
homer-odyssey-850_03	Tell me, therefore, Nestor, and tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that way?
homer-odyssey-850_03	Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging elsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed Agamemnon?"
homer-odyssey-850_03	What was Menelaus doing?
homer-odyssey-850_03	Who knows but what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels in full, either single- handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him?
homer-odyssey-850_03	Who, then, sir strangers, are you, and from what port have you sailed?
homer-odyssey-850_03	or do you sail the seas as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man''s hand against you?"
homer-odyssey-850_01	"Is that so?
homer-odyssey-850_01	And Jove said,"My child, what are you talking about?
homer-odyssey-850_01	But tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have such a fine looking fellow for a son?
homer-odyssey-850_01	But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people?
homer-odyssey-850_01	Has he brought you news about the return of your father, or was he on business of his own?
homer-odyssey-850_01	Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the family-- for no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own?
homer-odyssey-850_01	How can I forget Ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, nor more liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven?
homer-odyssey-850_01	Is this the worst fate you can think of for me?
homer-odyssey-850_01	Of what family is he, and where is his estate?
homer-odyssey-850_01	Tell me also truly, for I want to know, are you a stranger to this house, or have you been here in my father''s time?
homer-odyssey-850_01	What country does he come from?
homer-odyssey-850_01	What is it all about?
homer-odyssey-850_01	Why then should you keep on being so angry with him?"
homer-odyssey-850_01	You, sir, take no heed of this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice?
homer-iliad-850_21	"Who and whence are you,"said he,"who dare to face me?
homer-iliad-850_21	"Why, vixen,"said he,"have you again set the gods by the ears in the pride and haughtiness of your heart?
homer-iliad-850_21	Baby, why keep your bow thus idle?
homer-iliad-850_21	Bold vixen,"she cried,"how dare you cross me thus?
homer-iliad-850_21	But why commune with myself in this way?
homer-iliad-850_21	Could not even the waters of the grey sea imprison him, as they do many another whether he will or no?
homer-iliad-850_21	Have you forgotten how you set Diomed son of Tydeus on to wound me, and yourself took visible spear and drove it into me to the hurt of my fair body?
homer-iliad-850_21	I too-- see you not how I am great and goodly?
homer-iliad-850_21	Meanwhile King Neptune turned to Apollo saying,"Phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm''s length?
homer-iliad-850_21	Then Achilles said to himself in his surprise,"What marvel do I see here?
homer-iliad-850_21	Then he prayed to Juno and besought her saying,"Juno, why should your son vex my stream with such especial fury?
homer-iliad-850_21	What have I to do with quarrelling and helping people?"
homer-iliad-850_21	What, then, if I go out and meet him in front of the city?
homer-iliad-850_21	Why should you whine in this way?
homer-odyssey-850_07	Did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?"
homer-odyssey-850_07	She stood right in front of him, and Ulysses said:"My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alcinous?
homer-odyssey-850_07	Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those clothes?
homer-iliad-850_24	And Priam said,"Who are you, my friend, and who are your parents, that you speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy son?"
homer-iliad-850_24	And Thetis answered,"Why does the mighty god so bid me?
homer-iliad-850_24	And now tell me and tell me true, for how many days would you celebrate the funeral rites of noble Hector?
homer-iliad-850_24	Are you not afraid of the fierce Achaeans who are hard by you, so cruel and relentless?
homer-iliad-850_24	Did not Hector burn you thigh- bones of heifers and of unblemished goats?
homer-iliad-850_24	Have you no grief in your own homes that you are come to plague me here?
homer-iliad-850_24	His mother sat down beside him and caressed him with her hand saying,"My son, how long will you keep on thus grieving and making moan?
homer-iliad-850_24	How can you venture alone to the ships of the Achaeans, and look into the face of him who has slain so many of your brave sons?
homer-iliad-850_24	Is it a small thing, think you, that the son of Saturn has sent this sorrow upon me, to lose the bravest of my sons?
homer-iliad-850_24	Is my son still at the ships, or has Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him to his hounds?"
homer-iliad-850_24	Should some one of them see you bearing so much treasure through the darkness of the flying night, what would not your state then be?
homer-iliad-850_24	So, then, you would all be on the side of mad Achilles, who knows neither right nor ruth?
homer-iliad-850_24	What think you of this matter?
homer-odyssey-850_05	"Alas,"he cried to himself in his dismay,"what ever will become of me, and how is it all to end?
homer-odyssey-850_05	"My poor good man,"said she,"why is Neptune so furiously angry with you?
homer-odyssey-850_05	"What, my dear, are you talking about?"
homer-odyssey-850_05	Alas,"he said to himself in his dismay,"what ever will become of me?
homer-odyssey-850_05	Calypso gave Mercury a seat and said:"Why have you come to see me, Mercury-- honoured, and ever welcome-- for you do not visit me often?
homer-odyssey-850_05	replied her father,"did you not send him there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses to get home and punish the suitors?
homer-odyssey-850_08	Did you lose some brave kinsman of your wife''s when you were before Troy?
homer-odyssey-850_08	Ulysses answered,"Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way?
homer-odyssey-850_08	Where have you been wandering, and in what countries have you travelled?
homer-odyssey-850_08	a son- in- law or father- in- law-- which are the nearest relations a man has outside his own flesh and blood?
homer-odyssey-850_08	or was it some brave and kindly- natured comrade-- for a good friend is as dear to a man as his own brother?"
homer-odyssey-850_12	"''Is there no way,''said I,''of escaping Charybdis, and at the same time keeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?''
homer-odyssey-850_12	Why should not we drive in the best of these cows and offer them in sacrifice to the immortal gods?
homer-odyssey-850_06	"Alas,"said he to himself,"what kind of people have I come amongst?
homer-odyssey-850_06	"O queen,"he said,"I implore your aid-- but tell me, are you a goddess or are you a mortal woman?
homer-odyssey-850_06	Are they cruel, savage, and uncivilised, or hospitable and humane?
homer-odyssey-850_06	Can you not see a man without running away from him?
homer-odyssey-850_06	Do you take him for a robber or a murderer?
homer-odyssey-850_06	She stopped him and said:"Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon?
homer-odyssey-850_06	Where did she find him?
homer-odyssey-850_14	Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this way?
homer-odyssey-850_10	"And I answered,''Circe, how can you expect me to be friendly with you when you have just been turning all my men into pigs?
homer-odyssey-850_10	How can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you?
homer-odyssey-850_10	Is it that you are still suspicious?
homer-odyssey-850_10	She passed through the midst of us without our knowing it, for who can see the comings and goings of a god, if the god does not wish to be seen?
homer-odyssey-850_10	They were astounded when they saw us and said,''Ulysses, what brings you here?
homer-odyssey-850_10	What god has been ill- treating you?
homer-odyssey-850_10	You surely do not fancy that you can set them free?
homer-odyssey-850_10	from what place and people have you come?
homer-odyssey-850_09	Are you traders, or do you sail the sea as rovers, with your hands against every man, and every man''s hand against you?''
homer-odyssey-850_09	Surely no man is carrying off your sheep?
homer-odyssey-850_09	Surely no man is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force?''
homer-odyssey-850_09	Talk to me, indeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger?
homer-odyssey-850_09	Was it round the point, or is she lying straight off the land?''
homer-odyssey-850_09	When he had got through with all his work, he lit the fire, and then caught sight of us, whereon he said:"''Strangers, who are you?
homer-odyssey-850_09	Where do sail from?
homer-odyssey-850_09	You ought to be ashamed of yourself; how can you expect people to come see you any more if you treat them in this way?''
homer-odyssey-850_09	You wretch, eat up your visitors in your own house?
homer-odyssey-850_15	"The man who had seduced her then said,''Would you like to come along with us to see the house of your parents and your parents themselves?
homer-odyssey-850_15	Are they still living or are they already dead and in the house of Hades?"
homer-odyssey-850_15	Heaven help me,"he exclaimed,"what ever can have put such a notion as that into your head?
homer-odyssey-850_15	To whose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair?
homer-odyssey-850_15	Who and whence are you?
homer-odyssey-850_15	or shall I go straight to your own house and to your mother?"
homer-odyssey-850_15	{ 137} Then Theoclymenus said,"And what, my dear young friend, is to become of me?
homer-odyssey-850_13	"Alas,"he exclaimed,"among what manner of people am I fallen?
homer-odyssey-850_13	Am I on an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?"
homer-odyssey-850_13	And Jove answered,"What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking about?
homer-odyssey-850_13	Are they savage and uncivilised or hospitable and humane?
homer-odyssey-850_13	Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others are eating up his estate?"
homer-odyssey-850_13	Tell me then truly, have I really got back to my own country?"
homer-odyssey-850_13	Tell me, then, and tell me truly, what land and country is this?
homer-odyssey-850_13	Where shall I put all this treasure, and which way shall I go?
homer-odyssey-850_13	Who are its inhabitants?
homer-odyssey-850_13	{ 125}"But why,"said Ulysses,"did you not tell him, for you knew all about it?
homer-odyssey-850_19	"Madam,"answered Ulysses,"who on the face of the whole earth can dare to chide with you?
homer-odyssey-850_19	"My child,"answered Euryclea,"what are you talking about?
homer-odyssey-850_19	"This dream, Madam,"replied Ulysses,"can admit but of one interpretation, for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be fulfilled?
homer-odyssey-850_19	But who is to go with you and light you to the store- room?
homer-odyssey-850_19	Ulysses scowled at her and answered,"My good woman, why should you be so angry with me?
homer-odyssey-850_18	"Poor wretch,"said she,"are you gone clean out of your mind?
homer-odyssey-850_18	Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters-- so many of them too?
homer-odyssey-850_18	Can you build a stone fence, or plant trees?
homer-odyssey-850_18	Can you not carry your meat and your liquor decently?
homer-odyssey-850_18	Do you not see that they are all giving me the wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do not like to do so?
homer-odyssey-850_18	Has the wine been getting into your head or do you always babble in this way?
homer-odyssey-850_18	Has the wine been getting into your head, or do you always babble in this way?
homer-odyssey-850_18	On this Telemachus came forward and said,"Sirs, are you mad?
homer-odyssey-850_18	Then turning to Ulysses he said,"Stranger, will you work as a servant, if I send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid?
homer-odyssey-850_18	What is all this disturbance that has been going on, and how came you to allow a stranger to be so disgracefully ill- treated?
homer-odyssey-850_18	What would have happened if he had suffered serious injury while a suppliant in our house?
homer-odyssey-850_18	Will you go, then?
homer-odyssey-850_04	"''Can you show me,''said I,''some stratagem by means of which I may catch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out?
homer-odyssey-850_04	"''Son of Atreus,''he answered,''why ask me?
homer-odyssey-850_04	"I lent it him,"answered Noemon,"what else could I do when a man of his position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me to oblige him?
homer-odyssey-850_04	Am I, then, to leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me?
homer-odyssey-850_04	Are you on public, or private business?
homer-odyssey-850_04	As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said:"Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for?
homer-odyssey-850_04	At last, however, she said,"Why did my son leave me?
homer-odyssey-850_04	Does he want to die without leaving any one behind him to keep up his name?"
homer-odyssey-850_04	Is it to tell the maids to leave their master''s business and cook dinner for them?
homer-odyssey-850_04	Penelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered,"Sister, why have you come here?
homer-odyssey-850_04	Shall we take their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?"
homer-odyssey-850_04	So,"he exclaimed,"these cowards would usurp a brave man''s bed?
homer-odyssey-850_04	Tell me also, did you let him have the ship of your own free will because he asked you, or did he take it without your leave?"
homer-odyssey-850_04	Tell me truly, and what young men did he take with him?
homer-odyssey-850_04	Then, taking a seat near Telemachus he said:"And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage to Lacedaemon?
homer-odyssey-850_04	They thought he was only away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with the swineherd; so Antinous said,"When did he go?
homer-odyssey-850_04	Were they freemen or his own bondsmen-- for he might manage that too?
homer-odyssey-850_04	What are we to do?
homer-odyssey-850_04	What business had he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over the ocean like sea- horses?
homer-odyssey-850_04	What do you want?''
homer-odyssey-850_04	or is he dead?
homer-odyssey-850_04	{ 42}"Do we know, Menelaus,"said she,"the names of these strangers who have come to visit us?
homer-odyssey-850_22	But Agelaus shouted out,"Can not some one go up to the trap door and tell the people what is going on?
homer-odyssey-850_22	But Ulysses glared at them and said:"Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy?
homer-odyssey-850_22	He had no thought of death-- who amongst all the revellers would think that one man, however brave, would stand alone among so many and kill him?
homer-odyssey-850_22	How comes it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on your own ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house?
homer-odyssey-850_20	Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you throughout in all your troubles?
homer-odyssey-850_20	Are you still here, stranger,"said he,"to pester people by begging about the house?
homer-odyssey-850_20	Is he one of your men?
homer-odyssey-850_20	Theoclymenus saw this and said,"Unhappy men, what is it that ails you?
homer-odyssey-850_20	What is his family?
homer-odyssey-850_20	Where does he come from?
homer-odyssey-850_20	Who, Swineherd,"said he,"is this stranger that is lately come here?
homer-odyssey-850_20	Why can you not go elsewhere?
homer-odyssey-850_20	You beg without any sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere among the Achaeans, as well as here?"
homer-odyssey-850_16	"What is the news of the town?
homer-odyssey-850_16	And Ulysses said,"I am no god, why should you take me for one?
homer-odyssey-850_16	Are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven?
homer-odyssey-850_16	Have the suitors returned, or are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way home?"
homer-odyssey-850_16	How can I take this stranger into my house?
homer-odyssey-850_16	Madman, why should you try to compass the death of Telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witness is Jove himself?
homer-odyssey-850_16	May you not complain of your brothers-- for it is to these that a man may look for support, however great his quarrel may be?
homer-odyssey-850_16	Of what nation did they declare themselves to be-- for you can not have come by land?"
homer-odyssey-850_16	Tell me, do you submit to such treatment tamely, or has some god set your people against you?
homer-odyssey-850_11	"And I said,''Agamemnon, why do you ask me?
homer-odyssey-850_11	Are you all this time trying to find your way home from Troy, and have you never yet got back to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?''
homer-odyssey-850_11	But give me news about my son; is he gone to the wars and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so?
homer-odyssey-850_11	But now tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news of my son Orestes?
homer-odyssey-850_11	But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die?
homer-odyssey-850_11	Did you have a long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easy passage to eternity?
homer-odyssey-850_11	He knew me and said,''Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, why, poor man, have you left the light of day and come down to visit the dead in this sad place?
homer-odyssey-850_11	How did you come by your death,''said I,''King Agamemnon?
homer-odyssey-850_11	I was very sorry for him, and cried when I saw him:''Elpenor,''said I,''how did you come down here into this gloom and darkness?
homer-odyssey-850_11	Is he not tall and good looking, and is he not clever?
homer-odyssey-850_11	Then Arete said to them:--"What do you think of this man, O Phaeacians?
homer-odyssey-850_11	Then she knew me at once and spoke fondly to me, saying,''My son, how did you come down to this abode of darkness while you are still alive?
homer-odyssey-850_21	"You country louts,"said he,"silly simpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by crying in this way?
homer-odyssey-850_21	Are you out of your wits?
homer-odyssey-850_21	Say which you are disposed to do-- to side with the suitors, or with Ulysses?"
homer-odyssey-850_21	Shall, then, this bow take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you can not bend it yourself?
homer-odyssey-850_21	Then he took his seat again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him saying:"Leiodes, what are you talking about?
homer-odyssey-850_21	Today is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who can string a bow on such a day as this?
homer-odyssey-850_21	What manner of men would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back here all of a sudden?
homer-odyssey-850_21	Why then should you mind if men talk as you think they will?
homer-odyssey-850_21	You know this as well as I do; what need have I to speak in praise of my mother?
homer-odyssey-850_17	"What do you mean, Telemachus,"replied Antinous,"by this swaggering talk?
homer-odyssey-850_17	Do you think it a small thing that such people gather here to waste your master''s property-- and must you needs bring this man as well?"
homer-odyssey-850_17	Have we not tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat?
homer-odyssey-850_17	Is he afraid that some one will ill- treat him, or is he shy of coming inside the house at all?
homer-odyssey-850_17	Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to Eumaeus,"Go and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed just as I was speaking?
homer-odyssey-850_17	The swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she saw him cross the threshold,"Why do you not bring him here, Eumaeus?
homer-odyssey-850_17	Then Antinous said,"What god can have sent such a pestilence to plague us during our dinner?
homer-odyssey-850_17	Then Melanthius the goatherd answered,"You ill conditioned cur, what are you talking about?
homer-odyssey-850_17	Where, pray, master swineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object?
homer-odyssey-850_17	Why should you want to see this stranger turned out of the house?
homer-odyssey-850_17	Will you go inside first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you wait here and let me go in first?
homer-odyssey-850_17	You precious idiot,"he cried,"what have you brought this man to town for?
homer-odyssey-850_23	"My dear,"answered Ulysses,"why should you press me to tell you?
homer-odyssey-850_23	Then nurse Euryclea said,"My child, what are you talking about?
homer-odyssey-850_23	Who has been taking my bed from the place in which I left it?
homer-odyssey-850_23	Why do you not sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?
homer-odyssey-850_24	"Amphimedon,"it said,"what has happened to all you fine young men-- all of an age too-- that you are come down here under the ground?
homer-odyssey-850_24	And Jove answered,"My child, why should you ask me?
homer-odyssey-850_24	But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my fighting were done?
homer-odyssey-850_24	But tell me, and tell me true, how many years is it since you entertained this guest-- my unhappy son, as ever was?
homer-odyssey-850_24	Do you not remember how I came to your house with Menelaus, to persuade Ulysses to join us with his ships against Troy?
homer-odyssey-850_24	Is this place that I have come to really Ithaca?
homer-odyssey-850_24	Or were you a passenger on some other man''s ship, and those who brought you here have gone on their way and left you?"
homer-odyssey-850_24	Then Minerva said to Jove,"Father, son of Saturn, king of kings, answer me this question-- What do you propose to do?
homer-odyssey-850_24	Was it not by your own arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the suitors?
homer-odyssey-850_24	Where is the ship lying that has brought you and your men to Ithaca?
homer-odyssey-850_24	Who and whence are you-- tell me of your town and parents?
homer-odyssey-850_24	Will you set them fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?"
homer-odyssey-850_24	{ 187} But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return, or shall we send some one to tell her?"
