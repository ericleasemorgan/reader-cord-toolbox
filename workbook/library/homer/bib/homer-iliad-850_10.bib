Diomed looked sternly at him and answered," Think not, Dolon, for all the good information you have given us, that you shall escape now you are in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you will come some second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as a spy or as an open enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you, you will give no more trouble."	./cache/homer-iliad-850_10.txt	./txt/homer-iliad-850_10.txt
